<hr>

Howdy, I'm Hakko. I began development back in 2015 with Garry's Mod, from there I quickly grew into loving technology in general. I've since expanded my horizons from software development to game development, web development & design, system administration, cybersecurity, and starting my own hosting company. I appreciate everyone I've met along the way and everyone that's helped me get to where I am now.

I currently am streaming on [Twitch](https://twitch.hakko.dev) and uploading videos to [YouTube](https://youtube.hakko.dev) in my free time, feel free to stop by if you want.

Below you'll find a list of my current active projects.
